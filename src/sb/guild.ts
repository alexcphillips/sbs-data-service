# SkyHelperDataService

The SkyHelperDataService microservice is responsible for integrating with the SkyHelper API to fetch and process SkyBlock data. This README provides an overview of its purpose, functionality, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Purpose

SkyHelperDataService serves as a backend service within our microservices architecture, specifically designed to:

- Fetch SkyBlock data from the SkyHelper API.
- Parse, validate, and transform data into usable formats.
- Implement caching mechanisms for optimized data retrieval.

## Features

- **Data Integration**: Integrates seamlessly with the SkyHelper API to fetch various SkyBlock statistics and information.
- **Data Parsing**: Processes and validates retrieved data, ensuring consistency and reliability.
- **Caching Strategy**: Implements caching to improve performance by reducing API calls and latency.

## Setup

To set up and run SkyHelperDataService locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd SkyHelperDataService
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Configure Environment Variables:

Create a .env file based on .env.example and configure necessary environment variables (e.g., API keys, caching settings).
Run the Service:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Verify Service:

Open your browser or use a tool like Postman to send requests to the service endpoints (e.g., http://localhost:3000/api/data).
